## Estimation-of-Obesity-Levels
# About This Repository
This repository contains code for performing data exploration, visualization,
and applying machine learning models to predict obesity levels based on given features. 

# Machine Learning Models:
Decision Tree: Decision tree algorithms were applied to the dataset to create predictive models based on hierarchical decision rules.

Random Forest: Random forest models were utilized to improve predictive accuracy by aggregating the results of multiple decision trees.

Support Vector Machine (SVM): SVM algorithms were employed to find the hyperplane that best separates the different classes of obesity levels in the feature space.
